The quickest type of loan you’re likely to find is a short-term cash advance loan. These loans are typically small — less than $2,500 — and tend to have terms that last fewer than six months. Short-term loans are generally repaid as a single lump sum at the end of the loan, with both the principal amount and all applicable finance charges and fees due at the same time.

The major benefit to a short-term cash advance loan is the turnaround time; for most short-term loans, you can get an application decision in minutes, and receive your funds as soon as the next business day. Using an online lending network, such as our expert-rated options below, can give you multiple quotes at once to help ensure you get the lowest fees you can.
