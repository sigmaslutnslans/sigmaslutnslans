A longer-term alternative to cash advance loans, installment loans are repaid in a series of installments, typically monthly payments. Though not traditionally considered to be a fast loan when obtained from a bank, online installment loans often have quick application responses and can provide funds in as little as one business day in some cases.

Additionally, installment loans can give you up to 72 months to repay your loan, giving you the ability to choose a larger or smaller monthly payment. Installment loans are also available in much larger amounts than short-term loans, with some personal installment loan providers, such as those found on our top-rated lending networks below, offering loans up to $35,000.
